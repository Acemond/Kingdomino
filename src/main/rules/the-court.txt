This is a shortened version of the rules, you can find the rulebook on the left of the table.


This expansion is compatible with any game configuration.


Introduction
--------------

Using the resources generated by your kingdom, construct new buildings and recruit the
most influential character in the court!


How to play
--------------

The positioning and method of selecting the dominos is exactly the same as in the basic game.
The small board is placed above the rows of dominos. The first 3 tiles in the stack are revealed.
When the dominos are placed in their respective rows, you just add the resources to each square without a crown:

 - Wheat field > Wheat
 - Forest > Wood
 - Lakes > Fish
 - Meadow > Sheep
 - Swamp / Mines / Queendomino building sites: NOTHING!

Each person builds their kingdom following exactly the same rules as in the basic game. But in addition, at the end of their turn, they can:
- EITHER spend 2 different resources from their kingdom to recruit a character or construct a building from those that can be seen (the pieces selected in this way are only replaced when the following row of dominos is formed)

- OR spend 4 different resources from your kingdom to recruit a character or construct a building to be chosen from the pile of tiles that is face-down. The pile of tiles is shuffled and placed face-down afterwards.

A piece obtained in this way is placed on A SQUARE CONTAINING NO CROWN OR RESOURCE (but not necessarily on one of the squares containing the resources used for this purchase)
A building can only be placed on land that is appropriate (mill in a wheat field, etcâ€¦) Characters can be placed on any type of land (as long as there is no crown or resource)

Buildings give additional crowns for calculating points for the domains

Each character gives points according to a specific scale. Here, the merchant gets 2 basic points plus 2 additional points for each resource, of whatever type, present on the 8 squares surrounding it at the end of the game.
