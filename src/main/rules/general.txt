Welcome to the mod "Kingdomino (Scripted)" by Acemond.

Take your first steps with this guide and then turn the pages to get the games specific rules.


Setting up the Game
------------------------

Each player must chose a color or join the table by clicking on "Add Player". If one or more players are sharing the same computer, you must click the "Local Players" button then add them with the "Add Player" button.

When the amount of players is set, click the "Start Game" button.

You can also directly click the "Quick Setup" button corresponding to the amount of players playing and a game will automatically be launched with the corresponding amount of players.


Rules of the game
---------------------

Go to the section that corresponds to the game you picked or refer to the rulebooks on the left of the table.


Game Keys
------------
There are some shortcuts you can assign by going to Options -> Game Keys.


Kingdom Movement
-----------------------
According to the rules, your kingdom should not go above a 5x5 (or 7x7) square.
In order to have a visual clue of this limitation, your kingdom is surrounded by walls in this mod.
But in some cases you don't want to castle to remain in the middle of the kingdom.

With this mod, when you approach a domino to the limits of your kingdom, if there is no space for the domino,
the kingdom will automatically move to make room for it.

You can also move the kingdom manually using the arrows, and if you don't want it to move automatically at all,
you can click the lock. You will still be able to move it manually with the arrow buttons.


Score
------

Score is computed automatically through the whole duration of the game.
If you don't want to see the score during the whole game to keep the surprise,
you can go to Options -> Game Keys and assign a key to hide the score.
There are also score sheets to calculate manually the score at the bottom right of the table.
