In the Kingdomino game, players can choose to play with the following additional rules: "The Middle Kingdom" (10 additional points if your castle is in the center of your kingdom) and/or "Harmony" (5 additional points if your territory is complete and no domino has been discarded).

These two additional rules are now two Quest tiles among the 17 tiles in the quests deck. At the beginning of each game, two of the 17 tiles are randomly drawn and uncovered for all to see. Each tile shows a specific way to score bonus point at the end of a game. This makes all of your games unique!

You can get the details of each quests by hovering them with your mouse for 2 seconds.
