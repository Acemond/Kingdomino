This is a shortened version of the rules, you can find the rulebook on the left of the table.


This game mode uses two Kingdomino decks to enlarge the maximum kingdom size of 3 and 4 players game to a 7x7 square (instead of 5x5).

The script will automatically altern between the two decks at every turn.
All the rules of Kingdomino are unchanged.

Be aware that the mod uses the 3p player variant recommended by the author in a blog post:
 - In a 3p game, 4 dominos are dealt and the one left unpicked is discarded.
